In an age of technology and information privacy has become less and less attainable. Project G.O.D.S is an idealogy that companies will assist in a more direct way, while still giving the responsibility of choice to the users. 

We do not want to change how companies gather data, or to stop them from being able to collect data entirely, but to assist users in being aware of what is being collected and publicly shared. We also want to assist the user in making it easier to change the settings, and to initialize this at the beginning of a users experience with these platforms.
